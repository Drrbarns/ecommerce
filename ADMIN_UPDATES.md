# 🎉 Admin Panel Refresh
## Updates Applied:

1.  **Dashboard Analytics Refresh**
    - Added a "Refresh Data" button to the main dashboard.
    - This allows you to update the charts and stats (Revenue, Orders, etc.) on demand.

2.  **Media Library**
    - **New Page:** `Media Library` added to the sidebar.
    - **Features:**
        - View all uploaded images.
        - Upload new images directly.
        - Copy image URLs to clipboard.
        - Delete unused images.
    - This leverages the drag-and-drop uploader we built!

3.  **Database Sync**
    - Verified that all "Phase 1" tables (`order_timeline`, `media_uploads`) are present and working.
    - Analytics cache refresh logic is hooked up.
